# Miscelleneous tools for administration of a GUAR registry server

This repository holds the command line tools for working with the GeoFrenzy Unmanned Airframe Registry (GUAR) PowerDNS delegate servers.
When run, each Python file will ask a few questions, and will then use the information it's gathered to perform its task.

## `adddrone.py`
This registers a drone to the server with proper record types and encoding

## `setupdelegate.py`
`setupdelegate.py` configures a GUAR registry docker image for use
