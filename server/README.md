# GUAR Server

This directory contains the Dockerfile and shell script used to create a GUAR server, but initial setup must be completed using `setupdelegate.py` in `tools` from the parent directory.

A Docker image containing this GitHub repo is also available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/geofrenzy/utm-guar/).
